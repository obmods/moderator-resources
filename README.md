# OpenBazaar moderator resource center

Moderators play a critical role in the OpenBazaar ecosystem in alleviating risk to both the buyer and seller. They facilitate the resolution of disputes, and they allow funds to be trasferred when a mutual resolution between the two parties is not possible.

The aim of this repository is to bring together useful resources that moderators will be able to consult when managing disputed transactions. These include details regarding moderated transactions, the contents of OpenBazaar contracts, reputation of vendors and moderators, and policies regarding contractual disputes between parties.
